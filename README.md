FA Nexus is the new all-in-one content hub for Forgotten Adventures inside Foundry VTT. It brings tokens, assets, premium texture tools, and path editing into a single streamlined window. Launch the app from the FA Nexus button above the player list and dive straight into the full catalog of free Forgotten Adventures content—no manual setup required.

⚠️ **Beta notice:** v0.1.0 is our first public release. Expect occasional rough edges, placeholder copy, and the odd gremlin. Please keep the feedback coming so we can polish the experience quickly. We also plan on implementing more features so if you have a specific feature request drop that into issues too!

## Highlights at a Glance
- **Day-one library access:** Instantly browse the full Forgotten Adventures free catalog alongside your local folders, with cloud downloads keeping their original structure.
- **Smarter discovery:** Weighted search, exclusive or negative terms, grouped queries, and bookmarkable folder filters help you build personal collections per tab.
- **Pixel-perfect selection:** Precise tile hit detection respects transparent areas.
- **Responsive placement:** Click-to-place with sticky mode, multi-select randomization, rotation/scale controls, grid snapping and more tuned for both tokens and assets.
- **Elevation based Drop Shadow:** Elevation-based drop shadows for assets, bring new depth to your scenes!
- **Lightning-fast grids:** One-time indexing, virtualized scrolling, hover previews, and a thumbnail size slider keep browsing fluid even on massive scenes.
- **Cloud + local harmony:** Cloud Downloads keep the full folder structure, smart de-duplication and high-quality cloud thumbnails for matched local files, local folders stay in sync with folder filters & bookmarks.
- **Premium unlocks:** Subscribers at Adventurer ($7) or higher get access to Premium Tokens & Assets as well as texture painting and path editors, plus future premium features.
- **Texture painting studio *(Adventurer tier $7+)*:** Premium supporters unlock brush and fill tools with live transforms for rapid terrain blending.

## Smart Search, Folders, and Bookmarks
- **Weighted matching:** Nexus boosts likely hits so “fir” gives you fir trees before fireballs.
- **Exact and negative terms:** Wrap a term in quotes to match exactly like `"orc"`, or prefix with `-` to hide unwanted results. Combine statements with parentheses for more complex filters.
- **Docked folder filters:** See and filter by our Folder Structure. Pick inclusion and exclusion folders with multi-select.
- **Bookmark anything:** Save your favorite combinations of search terms and folder filters for Tokens, Assets, Textures, or Paths. Bookmarks show in a toolbar, overflow gracefully, and can be dragged to reorder.
- **Search memory:** Each tab remembers its last query and folder state, so hopping between views doesn’t wipe your work.

---

## Tokens Tab
- **Click-to-place workflow:** Click once to start placement, then drop tokens directly onto the canvas. Sticky mode keeps the placement cursor active for batch drops.
- **Multi-select randomizer:** Select several tokens and let Nexus randomize which one lands next.
- **Radom Color on Placement:** Randomize colors of selected Token(s) on drop.
- **Place Token As:** Choose an existing actor from your world or compendium to place token as that actor.
- **Hit point presets:** Use the actor default, roll a formula, apply a percentage, add a ±variance, or enter a custom value—even per placement session.
- **Grid savvy:** Snap to grid, rotate, mirror, or randomize facing before every drop.
- **Super Wildcards:** Combination of the systems above allow you to essentially havea "super" wildcard placement. e.g. Multiselect All our NPCs, Activate "Random Color on Placement", choose "Commoner" statblock as "Place Token As" , activate random rotation and flip & start placing!  You'll get a random NPC with random color and random rotation with each click!

---

## Assets Tab
- **Same placement magic:** Sticky mode, random rotation, mirroring, scaling, and grid snapping work just like the Tokens tab—plus randomized scale offsets for organic placement.
- **Elevation on the fly:** Hold `Alt` + scroll to bump placement elevation by 0.1 increments. Decimal elevations keep assets layered without jumping ahead of tokens (override in settings if you prefer Foundry defaults).
- **Shadow presets per elevation:** Customize drop shadow alpha, blur, dilation, angle, and distance for each elevation level. Save up to five presets and reapply them with a click.
- **Multi-select randomizer:** Select several assets and let Nexus randomize which one lands next. Combine with random rotation and scale!

## Premium Texture Painting *(Adventurer tier $7+)*
- **Brush-based painting:** Freehand grungy brushes with adjustable size & opacity.
- **Fill & mask tools:** Flood fill, rectangle, ellipse, polygonal lasso all support snap-to-grid for precise coverage.
- **Eraser mode**: Brush & fill tools support Eraser mode too.
- **Texture transforms:** Adjust opacity, scale, rotation, and UV offset mid-session without leaving the tool.
- **Texture swap:** Simply select a different texture from the main window to swap textures during editing.
- **Save as Tile**: Once you are happywith the masked texture, press S to save as Foundry Tile!

---

## Premium Path Placement *(Adventurer tier $7+)*
- **Make it curve:** Drop control points to form smooth curves, adjust tension, support snap to grid.
- **Path Texture controls:** Set scale, opacity, flip and offsets on the fly.
- **Feathered endings:** Taper opacity, shrink width on both ends independently for natural blends.
- **Per-point width control:** Pinch or bulge individual points for finer width adjustments.
- **Instant interactivity cleanup:** Cancel or stop sessions to release canvas locks and restore default tile interaction automatically.
- **Texture swap:** Simply select a different texture from the main window to swap textures during editing.
- **Save as Tile**: Once you are happywith the masked texture, press S to save as Foundry Tile!

## Quality of Life & Performance
- **One-time indexing:** On your first launch Nexus indexes cloud + local content, so later sessions pop open quickly.
- **Virtualized grids:** Only visible cards render, keeping framerates stable on massive libraries.
- **Placement prefetcher:** Random placement queues download ahead of time so you never drop an empty tile.
- **Edit existing textures & paths:** Right click the tile and select "Edit <tile> in FA Nexus" on the right side
- **Forge VTT compatible:** Works in Forge environments—testing is ongoing, so please report anything odd.
- **Offline awareness:** Cloud sync pauses politely when no connection is detected instead of spamming retries.
